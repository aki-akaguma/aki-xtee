### `aki-xtee` Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the `aki-xtee` utility using the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS).

#### **Ubiquitous Requirements**
*   The `aki-xtee` shall read data from standard input.
*   The `aki-xtee` shall write all data received from standard input to standard output.

#### **Event-Driven Requirements**
*   When file paths are provided as arguments, the `aki-xtee` shall write the input data to the specified files.
*   When writing to a file that already exists, the `aki-xtee` shall overwrite the file by default.
*   When writing to a file, the `aki-xtee` shall inspect the file's extension to determine the compression format.
*   When the output file has no recognized compression extension, the `aki-xtee` shall write the data as plain text.
*   When the output file has a `.gz` extension, the `aki-xtee` shall compress the data using gzip.
*   When the output file has an `.xz` extension, the `aki-xtee` shall compress the data using xz.
*   When the output file has a `.zst` extension, the `aki-xtee` shall compress the data using zstd.
*   When the output file has a `.bz2` extension, the `aki-xtee` shall compress the data using bzip2.
*   When the output file has a `.lz4` extension, the `aki-xtee` shall compress the data using lz4.
*   When the user provides the `--help` or `-H` flag, the `aki-xtee` shall display usage information and exit.
*   When the user provides the `--version` or `-V` flag, the `aki-xtee` shall display version information and exit.

#### **Optional Features (Future Implementation)**
*   Where the `--append` or `-a` flag is available, when the flag is provided with a file, the `aki-xtee` shall append to that file instead of overwriting it.
*   Where the `--pipe-out` or `-p` flag is available, when the flag is provided with a number, the `aki-xtee` shall write to the corresponding pipe.
